# Pome
POME (Picture Organization Made Easy) is a Web App that organizes images with tags as a way for users to easily store and locate their media.

COMP 3583 - HCI project 

Group: Greg's Favourite Group

Members: Elianna McKinnon, Liam Jones



How to run:

The app is built using Spring-Boot and should be compiled using the build automation tool, Maven.

Once the app requirements have been met, the app can be run with the following command via terminal from within the project directory (wherever you have extracted the Pome archive)

mvn clean spring-boot:run

Then, open a browser and navigate to localhost:8080

There is a functioning backend system, though due to unexpected setbacks during the app's development, some backend functionality is not properly interfaced with the frontend. Because of this, and because it was decided it would be easier to test implemented frontend functionality, changes to the gallery will be reset on page refresh.




Requirements:

- Java 8
- Apache Maven
